Spacetime
 - 3 dimentsional at the macro level
 - Time is 4th dimension
 - Matter attracts other matter with a force called gravity
 - The laws of physics hold true for all frames of reference
 - Based on your frame of reference, time will always move along at the same rate
 - Time in other areas of space and therefore for other matter might move at a different rate relative to your frame of reference 
Energy 
 - Everything in 4d spacetime is made of energy
 - Energy can't be created or destroyed
 - A form of energy is light
    - Light travels at the speed of information
    - Light has a 3d trajectory
    - Light is emitted by matter
    - Light consists of a wavelength
        - 
    - The energy of light is related to its wavelength
    - Light can be bent/difracted when it travels between mediums of different densities and similar transparency
    - Light can be reflected when it encounters a reflective matter. 
 - Another form of emergy is matter
    - Matter is made out of atoms
        - Atoms are made out of electrons, neutrons and protons
            - Electrons have a negative electric charge
            - Protons have a postitive electric charge
                - Protons are made of 3 quarks, 2 Ups and 1 Down
            - Neutrons have no electric charge
         - The nucleus of an atom contains the protons and neutrons
         - The nucleus bombarded by an electrons has a low chance of hitting the nucleus (assuming because it is small)
    - The energy of matter is related to it's mass and it's momentum
        
    - Mass is a property of matter
    - matter can be moved.
 - Energy bends spacetime
