# Universe Simulator

## Description

Universe Simulator is a program that allows you to simulate the universe using various theories like relativity, string theory, and the quantum standard model. It aims to test the fundamental properties of the universe through simulations and analysis.

## Features

- Simulate the universe based on different theories
- Explore the behavior of particles and celestial bodies
- Analyze and visualize simulation results
- Test the fundamental properties of the universe using a unit testing framework

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:dylanclement/universe-simulator.git
    ```

2. Build the solution:

    ```shell
    dotnet build
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the unit tests

    ```shell
    dotnet test
    ```

## Tests (draft)
### Spacetime
 - <s>3 dimentsional at the macro level</s>
 - <s>Time is 4th dimension</s>
 - Matter attracts other matter with a force called gravity
 - The laws of physics hold true for all frames of reference
 - Based on your frame of reference, time will always move along at the same rate
 - Time in other areas of space and therefore for other matter might move at a different rate relative to your frame of reference 
### Energy 
 - Everything in 4d spacetime is made of energy
 - Energy can't be created or destroyed
 - A form of energy is light
    - Light travels at the speed of information
    - Light has a 3d trajectory
    - Light is emitted by matter
    - Light has of a wavelength
    - The energy of light is related to its wavelength
    - Light can be bent/difracted when it travels between mediums of different densities and similar transparency
    - Light can be reflected when it encounters a reflective matter. 
 - Another form of emergy is matter
    - Matter is made out of atoms
        - Atoms are made out of electrons, neutrons and protons
            - Electrons have a negative electric charge
            - Protons have a postitive electric charge
                - Protons are made of 3 quarks, 2 Ups and 1 Down
            - Neutrons have no electric charge
         - The nucleus of an atom contains the protons and neutrons
         - The nucleus bombarded by an electrons has a low chance of hitting the nucleus (assuming because it is small)
    - The energy of matter is related to it's mass and it's momentum
        
    - Mass is a property of matter
    - matter can be moved.
 - Energy bends spacetime
